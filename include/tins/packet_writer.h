 * \class PacketWriter
 * \brief Writes PDUs to a pcap format file.
 *
 * This class can be used to write packets into a <i>pcap</i> format
 * file. It supports both writing packets one by one, or writing all
 * packets in a range (provided by iterators), so you can use it
 * to dump all packets in a vector.
 *
 * Since you might use both PDU objects and pointers to them,
 * both the PacketWriter::write overload that takes a single object
 * or the one that takes an iterator range accept a PDU reference type
 * as well as any type that can be dereferenced until a PDU type is found.
 * This means you can use both raw and smart pointers. 
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * \code
 * // Differents types holding PDUs
 * EthernetII object;
 * std::shared_ptr<PDU> smart_ptr = ...;
 * std::vector<std::shared_ptr<PDU>> vt = ....;
 *
 * // The writer we'll use
 * PacketWriter writer("/tmp/file.pcap", DataLinkType<EthernetII>());
 *
 * // Now write all of them
 * writer.write(object);
 * writer.write(smart_ptr);
 * writer.write(vt.begin(), vt.end());
 * \endcode

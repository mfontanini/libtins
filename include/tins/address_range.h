 * network and broadcast addresses are discarded:
 *
 * \code
 * auto range = IPv4Address("192.168.5.0") / 24;
 * for(const auto& addr : range) {
 *     // process 192.168.5.1-254, .0 and .255 are discarded
 *     process(addr);
 * }
 *
 * // That's only valid for iteration, not for AddressRange<>::contains
 *
 * assert(range.contains("192.168.5.0")); // works
 * assert(range.contains("192.168.5.255")); // works
 * \endcode
 *
 * Ranges created using AddressRange(address_type, address_type)
 * will allow the iteration over the entire range:
 *
 * \code
 * AddressRange<IPv4Address> range("192.168.5.0", "192.168.5.255");
 * for(const auto& addr : range) {
 *     // process 192.168.5.0-255, no addresses are discarded
 *     process(addr);

 *
 * assert(range.contains("192.168.5.0")); // still valid

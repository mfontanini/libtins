/** 
 * \class PDU
 * \brief Base class for protocol data units.
 *
 * Every PDU implementation inherits from this class. 
 *
 * PDUs can contain 0 or 1 inner PDU. By stacking several PDUs together,
 * you can construct packets. These are created upwards: upper layers 
 * will be children of the lower ones. 
 *
 * If you want to find a specific protocol within a PDU chain, you can use
 * PDU::find_pdu and PDU::rfind_pdu. Both of them take a template parameter
 * that indicates the PDU type you are looking for. The first one returns a 
 * pointer to the first object of that type, and the second one returns a 
 * reference (and throws if it is not found). 
 * 
 * For example:
 *
 * \code
 * // Take a whole packet from somewhere.
 * EthernetII packet = ...;
 *
 * // Find the IP layer
 * const IP* ip = packet.find_pdu<IP>();
 * if(ip) {
 *     // If the pointer is not null, then it will point to the IP layer
 * }
 *
 * // Find the TCP layer. This will throw a pdu_not_found exception
 * // if there is no TCP layer in this packet.
 * const TCP& tcp = packet.rfind_pdu<TCP>();
 * \endcode
 *
 * PDU objects can be serialized. Serialization converts the entire PDU
 * stack into a vector of bytes. This process might modify some parameters
 * on packets depending on which protocols are used in it. For example:
 *
 * - If the lowest protocol layer is IP (this means that there is no 
 * link layer protocol in the packet), then it calculates the source address
 * that should be used in that IP PDU. \sa IP
 * - If a protocol contains a checksum field, its value will be calculated
 * and included in its serialized contents.
 * - If a protocol contains a "next protocol" field, it is also set based
 * on the type of the next PDU in the packet.
 *
 * If you want to serialize a packet, just use PDU::serialize:
 *
 * \code
 * // Construct a packet
 * EthernetII packet = EthernetII() / IP() / TCP() / RawPDU("hello");
 *
 * // Now serialize it. This is a std::vector<uint8_t>.
 * PDU::serialization_type buffer = packet.serialize();
 * \endcode

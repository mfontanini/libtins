 * being open, it starts tracking it. This will follow all data sent by
 * each peer and make it available to the user in a simple way.
 *
 * In order to use this class, just create an instance and set the
 * new stream callback to some function that you want:
 *
 * \code
 * void on_new_stream(TCPStream& stream) {
 *     // Do something with it.
 *     // This is the perfect time to set the stream's client/server
 *     // write callbacks so you are notified whenever there's new
 *     // data on the stream
 * }
 *
 * // Create it
 * StreamFollower follower;
 * // Set the callback
 * follower.new_stream_callback(&on_new_stream);
